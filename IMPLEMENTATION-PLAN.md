# SIM Implementation Plan: Zero Tech Debt Approach

## Overview
This plan prioritizes building a production-ready foundation from day one, allowing us to rapidly prototype while maintaining code quality that scales directly to production without rewrites.

## Core Principles
1. **Production Architecture, MVP Features** - Use production-grade patterns but implement minimal feature sets first
2. **Type Safety Throughout** - TypeScript strict mode from the start prevents technical debt
3. **Test as You Build** - Write tests for critical paths during development, not after
4. **Progressive Enhancement** - Each feature is built to be extended, not replaced
5. **Infrastructure as Code** - All configuration is version controlled and reproducible
6. **Single Source of Truth** - Centralized data definitions to prevent duplication

## Current Project Status (Last Updated: January 2025)

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
1. Every component has TypeScript interfaces
2. Business logic is tested
3. API calls use React Query
4. Forms use React Hook Form
5. Styling uses Tailwind classes
6. Components are documented
7. Accessibility is built-in

### Architecture Decisions
1. **State Management**: Zustand for global, React Query for server
2. **Styling**: Tailwind with component classes
3. **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
4. **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
5. **API**: REST with GraphQL preparation
6. **Real-time**: WebSockets with fallbacks

### Progressive Enhancement Path
Each feature is built with these extensions in mind:
- **Authentication**: Basic → OAuth → SSO → 2FA
- **Search**: Simple → Advanced → AI-powered
- **Tracking**: Individual → Bulk → Automated
- **Alerts**: Email → SMS → Webhook → Integration
- **Reports**: Basic → Scheduled → Custom → API

## Success Metrics
- **Prototype Phase**: Feature completeness, UX validation
- **Production Phase**: Performance, reliability, scalability

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Technical Debt**: Enforced by linting and type checking
2. **Performance**: Monitored from day one
3. **Scalability**: Architecture supports horizontal scaling
4. **Security**: Security-first development approach
5. **Maintenance**: Comprehensive documentation and tests

## Zero Tech Debt Development Workflow

### For Every Feature Implementation:
1. **Plan First**
   - Review existing patterns in codebase
   - Design component/API interfaces
   - Consider future extensibility

2. **Type Everything**
   - Define TypeScript interfaces first
   - Use strict type checking
   - No `any` types allowed

3. **Build Incrementally**
   - Start with minimal working version
   - Add features progressively
   - Keep each commit functional

4. **Test Critical Paths**
   - Write tests for business logic
   - Test error scenarios
   - Ensure accessibility

5. **Document as You Go**
   - Add JSDoc comments for complex logic
   - Update component documentation
   - Keep API docs current

### Code Quality Checklist (Before Each PR)
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` - Must pass with 0 warnings
- [ ] Run `npm run typecheck` - Must pass
- [ ] Run `npm run format` - Code formatted
- [ ] Run `npm test` - All tests passing
