### Introduction

SynMax Intelligence Marketplace

The SynMax Intelligence Marketplace (SIM) provides customers with an affordable and flexible way to access SynMax's data and analytics. Accessible through the SynMax Intelligence website, SIM allows users to create an account and enroll for free, making it easy to get started with minimal commitment.

### What is SIM?

The SynMax Intelligence Marketplace will merge key elements of SaaS and e-commerce business models, offering clients a self-service, pay-as-you-go platform to access SynMax products. At launch, SIM will leverage existing SynMax capabilities and data, delivering them through an automated workflow. This approach enables revenue generation from existing data while minimizing resource requirements.

### Target Audience

The maritime industry is a cost-conscious market segment that prioritizes risk-based vessel tracking and legal exposure alerts rather than continuous monitoring or in-depth analytics. This customer profile aligns with industries where compliance, liability, and financial exposure drive decision-making.

### Key Takeaways from Customer Needs:

1.  Price Sensitivity → They won't pay for continuous tracking; they need cost-effective, event-driven intelligence.
2.  Lack of Analysts → They require automated alerts and risk summaries, not raw data.
3.  Risk-Triggered Tracking → Only interested in vessel movements when a compliance, legal, or security risk arises.
4.  Legal Exposure Focus → Need clear insights into sanctions violations, insurance liabilities, or regulatory breaches.

To effectively capture this customer segment, the ideal product offering should:

- Event-Driven → Only track vessels when a risk threshold is met (e.g., sanctions breach, port calls in high-risk areas).
- Low-Touch, High-Automation → Use Al-driven alerts to flag risk without requiring an analyst.
- Compliance-Focused Generate clear, actionable legal exposure reports. Cost-Effective → Offer pay-as-you-go or tiered pricing instead of expensive subscriptions.

### Potential Customers

Banks & Trade Finance (e.g., HSBC, Citi) → Need alerts on sanctioned or deceptive shipping practices.
Marine Insurers & P&I Clubs (e.g., Lloyd's, NorthStandard) → Want risk alerts before issuing policies.
Commodities & Energy Traders (e.g., Glencore, Vitol) → Avoid buying from non-compliant supply chains.
Shipping & Logistics Firms (e.g., K+N, DHL) → Need alerts on detained or non-compliant vessels.

### Product Offering - Vessel Tracking Service (VTS)

Leveraging Theia's existing capabilities, SIM will provide users with a flexible, customized vessel tracking solution tailored to their specific needs. Tracking will be tied to the vessel's IMO number, ensuring reliability even amid flag or MMSI changes. Users can monitor vessels based on a variety of criteria, enabling precise and adaptable tracking.

### Criteria

AIS reporting - updated location information on 3-6-12-24hr intervals
Dark Event - Detection of AIS signal loss (start and end of dark period).
Spoofing Event / GPS Manipulation - Identify vessels falsifying locations.
STS event - Monitor mid-sea cargo exchanges
PoC (Port of Call) - Detect vessels arriving or departing from key ports.
Vessel in Distress.
Ownership Change.
Flag / MMSI Change - Identify sudden flag or MMSI changes
Vessel AOI/Geofencing alerts - User defined.
Risk Assessment Change - Changes to SynMax automated risk assessment.
High Risk Area.

### Pricing Model

Vessel Tracking Service will be offered on a per-vessel basis, with pricing determined by the tracking duration and the number of selected criteria. To encourage customers to opt for higher-value plans, we will introduce tiered pricing models with built-in incentives, including:

Bulk Purchase Discounts - Customers can buy tracking for 5, 10, 25, or 50 vessels at a reduced rate.
Predefined Packages - Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze tiers offer preset tracking parameters at a discounted price, providing a cost-effective solution for various monitoring needs.

### Features and Benefits

Vessel Tracking Service provides a low-cost, commitment-free entry point for price-sensitive clients, eliminating contractual barriers.
