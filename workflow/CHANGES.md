### Status: COMPLETED

### Task Completed

Phase 0.2: Security & Architecture Quick Fixes - Hardening security and cleaning up architecture issues

### Key Changes

#### Security Improvements

1. **JWT_SECRET Validation**:
   - Added comprehensive JWT_SECRET validation in `/server/src/config.ts`
   - Validates presence, length (min 32 chars), and prevents use of default values
   - Added startup warnings for development mode
   - Created secure example in `.env.example`
   - Tests: `/server/src/config.test.ts`

2. **Secure Session Management**:
   - Removed localStorage persistence from authStore
   - Implemented memory-only session storage
   - Added automatic sensitive field sanitization (passwords, API keys, etc.)
   - Added `initializeAuthFromServer()` for httpOnly cookie-based sessions
   - Tests: `/src/features/auth/services/__tests__/secure-session.test.ts`

3. **CSRF Protection for Auth Endpoints**:

   - Silent fails for expected errors (session restore, CSRF fetch)

2. **Error Boundary Implementation**:
   - Added ErrorBoundary to wrap entire app in `/src/main.tsx`
   - Configured with production error reporting hook
   - Added TODO for future monitoring service integration
   - Tests: `/tests/integration/error-boundary.test.tsx`

#### Architecture Cleanup

1. **Empty Directory Removal**:

### Status: COMPLETED

### Task Completed

Phase 0.1: State Management Consolidation - Fixing the credit balance triple-state problem

### Key Changes

#### Files Modified

- `/src/features/auth/types/auth.ts` - Removed `credits` field from User and UserSubscription types
- `/src/features/auth/services/authStore.ts` - Removed deprecated `updateCredits` method
- `/src/components/layout/core/Header.tsx` - Updated to use `useCredits()` hook instead of `user.credits`
- `/src/features/dashboard/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` - Updated to use credit balance from creditStore
- `/src/features/shared/hooks/useCreditDeduction.ts` - Updated to use creditStore directly
- `/src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx` - Updated subscription display to use creditStore
- `/src/pages/credits/CreditsPage.tsx` - Updated to use credit balance from creditStore
- `/server/src/routes/credits.ts` - Updated mock server to use separate credit balance store

#### Test Files Updated

- `/tests/integration/credits/credit-state-sync.test.tsx` - Added comprehensive state sync tests
- `/tests/integration/credits/credit-balance.test.tsx` - Updated expectations for single source of truth
- `/src/features/auth/services/__tests__/authStore.test.ts` - Removed updateCredits tests
- Various test files - Removed credits field from mock user objects

### Implementation Details

1. **Single Source of Truth**:
   - Removed `credits` field from User type (was marked as deprecated)
   - Removed `credits` and `creditsUsed` from UserSubscription type
   - All credit balance data now exclusively in creditStore

2. **Component Migration**:
   - Header component now uses `useCredits()` hook for balance display
   - Dashboard page uses creditStore for low balance warnings
   - Profile page displays credits from creditStore instead of subscription
   - All components properly import and use credit hooks

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - Added comprehensive credit state synchronization tests
   - Tests verify no credits field exists on User type
   - Tests ensure components use creditStore exclusively
   - Tests verify WebSocket updates only affect creditStore

4. **Mock Server Updates**:
   - Created separate credit balance store in mock server
   - Removed dependency on user.credits in API routes
   - Maintains backward compatibility for API responses

### Technical Improvements

- Eliminated race conditions between multiple credit update paths
- Simplified state management with single source of truth
- Improved type safety by removing deprecated fields
- Better separation of concerns between auth and credits

### Verification

- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ ESLint passing with no errors
- ✅ Visual testing with Puppeteer confirms UI working correctly
- ✅ Credit display shows properly in Header ($0.00 Credits for test user)
- ✅ Low balance warnings functioning correctly

### Next Steps

- Phase 0.2: API Contract Updates (update API responses to match new structure)
- Phase 0.3: WebSocket Event Consolidation
- Continue with remaining Phase 0 critical fixes

## 2025-05-27: Bulk Purchase Options Implementation - Phase 1.1, Task 5 ✅
