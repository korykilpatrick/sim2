# SIM Project Changes Log

## 2025-01-25: WebSocket Test Coverage Implementation

### Task Completed
Implemented comprehensive test coverage for WebSocket functionality as part of Phase 1: Test Foundation initiative.

### Key Changes
- Added 4 new test files with 1,764 lines of test code
- Achieved 51 passing tests out of 64 total for WebSocket components
- Covered all critical WebSocket functionality

### Files Added
- `src/services/__tests__/websocket.test.ts` - WebSocketService unit tests (29 tests)
- `src/hooks/__tests__/useWebSocket.test.tsx` - useWebSocket hook tests (22 tests)
- `src/providers/__tests__/WebSocketProvider.test.tsx` - Provider component tests
- `tests/integration/websocket-integration.test.tsx` - Integration tests

### Test Coverage Areas
1. **WebSocketService Tests**:
   - Singleton pattern implementation
   - Connection/disconnection lifecycle
   - Authentication flow with JWT
   - Room management (vessel and area rooms)
   - Event handling and subscriptions
   - Reconnection logic with exponential backoff
   - State management and cleanup
   - Edge cases and error scenarios

2. **useWebSocket Hook Tests**:
   - Auto-connection when authenticated
   - State synchronization with service
   - Event subscription management
   - Room join/leave functionality
   - Alert management methods
   - Cleanup on unmount

3. **Integration Tests**:
   - Full connection flow
   - Real-time event handling
   - Multi-component state sharing
   - Error and reconnection scenarios

### Issues Discovered
- Minor TypeScript errors in test files (unused imports)
- Import path issues between test utilities
- Room rejoin timing issue after reconnection (rooms are rejoined before authentication completes)

### Test Results
- **Before**: 0% test coverage on WebSocket components
- **After**: 51/64 tests passing for WebSocket functionality
- **Overall Project**: 88 passing tests out of 178 total

### Technical Debt
- 13 failing integration tests need investigation
- Coverage metrics not calculating correctly
- Room rejoin logic could be improved to wait for authentication

### Rollback Command
```bash
git revert fe6bb45
```

### Next Steps
- Fix remaining integration test failures
- Continue with Authentication flow tests
- Work towards 80% overall coverage goal
