# SIM Codebase Analysis
*Updated: January 26, 2025*

## Executive Summary
The SIM (SynMax Intelligence Marketplace) frontend has made progress on implementing the CreditsPage UI component. We successfully:
- Changed CreditsPage from default to named export
- Added proper loading states and error handling
- Added data-testid attributes for testing
- Implemented WebSocket credit update subscriptions
- Fixed all TypeScript errors (0 errors)

However, the credit integration tests are still failing due to API handler configuration issues in the test environment.

## Current Status
- **Test Coverage**: Still at 79.14% (277/350 tests passing)
- **TypeScript Errors**: 0 ✅
- **ESLint Errors**: 0 ✅
- **ESLint Warnings**: 126 (unchanged)

## Work Completed on CreditsPage

### 1. Export Structure Fixed
- Changed from `export default` to `export function CreditsPage()`
- Updated App.tsx lazy loading to handle named export

### 2. Authentication Handling
- Added check for `isAuthenticated` state
- Shows "Please log in to view your credits" when not authenticated

### 3. Loading States
- Added loading spinner with `data-testid="loading-spinner"`
- Shows centered spinner during data fetch

### 4. Error Handling
- Shows "Failed to load credit balance" on error
- Includes Retry button that calls `refetch()`

### 5. Credit Display Updates
- Current balance displays with `data-testid="credit-balance"`
- Uses `balance.toLocaleString()` for proper number formatting
- Shows lifetime credits in separate card
- Displays expiring credits with dates when available

### 6. WebSocket Integration
- Subscribes to `credit_balance_updated` events
- Also listens for custom window event `ws:credit-update`
- Triggers refetch when balance updates are received
- Handles case when WebSocket is disabled (in tests)

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Mock Handler URL Mismatch
- Tests expect handlers at `/api/v1/*` (relative URLs)
- Fixed by updating mock handler URLs from absolute to relative
- However, handlers still not being picked up by MSW in tests

### 2. Dual Credit System Architecture
- `/features/credits` uses: `{ current, lifetime, expiringCredits }`
- `/features/shared` uses: `{ available, lifetime, expiring }`
- Tests written for features/credits structure
- Mock handlers exist for both systems

### 3. Test Environment Issues
- MSW not intercepting requests despite handlers being registered
- Tests stay in loading state indefinitely
- WebSocket disabled in test environment (expected)

## Technical Analysis

### Why Tests Are Still Failing
The credit balance integration tests are failing because:
1. MSW is not intercepting the API requests
2. The component stays in loading state waiting for API response
3. The test assertions timeout looking for content that never renders

Potential causes:
- Handler registration timing issue
- Request URL mismatch between client and handlers
- Test setup/teardown not properly configured

### Code Quality Observations
- TypeScript compliance is excellent (0 errors)
- Component follows React best practices
- Proper separation of concerns
- Good use of hooks and effects

## Next Steps to Reach 80% Coverage

### Option 1: Fix Integration Tests (Recommended)
1. Debug MSW handler registration in test environment
2. Ensure handlers are available before component renders
3. Verify API client base URL matches handler patterns
4. Consider using MSW's request logging to debug

### Option 2: Add More Unit Tests
1. Add tests for untested utility functions
2. Add more service layer tests
3. Add component unit tests that mock hooks

### Option 3: Minimal UI Stubs
1. Create minimal implementations of missing components
2. Just enough to make integration tests pass
3. Would immediately push coverage above 80%

## Architecture Recommendations

### 1. Consolidate Credit Systems
- Choose one credit data structure
- Migrate all code to use single implementation
- Update all tests to match

### 2. Improve Test Infrastructure
- Create better test utilities for MSW setup
- Add request/response logging in test mode
- Document proper test patterns

### 3. Component Testing Strategy
- Separate integration tests from unit tests
- Mock at appropriate boundaries
- Test components in isolation when possible
