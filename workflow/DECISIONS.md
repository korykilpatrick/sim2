# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This file documents all significant architectural and technical decisions made during the development of the SIM project.

## Format
Each decision should include:
- Date and context
- Decision made
- Alternatives considered
- Rationale
- Consequences (positive and negative)
- Related changes (reference CHANGES.md)

## 2025-01-25: Test-First Development Mandate

**Context**: The codebase has grown to 357 files with 0% test coverage, making it impossible to refactor safely or validate AI-generated code.

**Decision**: Implement mandatory test-first development (TDD) for all new code. No exceptions.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Continue without tests (rejected: too risky for production)
2. Add tests after implementation (rejected: often skipped)
3. Only test critical paths (rejected: unclear boundaries)

**Rationale**:
- AI-assisted development requires tests to validate correctness
- Tests serve as executable documentation
- TDD forces better design decisions
- Prevents regression as codebase grows

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Higher code quality, confident refactoring, living documentation
- Positive: AI tools can generate better code with clear test specifications
- Negative: Initial development slightly slower
- Negative: Requires discipline and workflow changes

## 2025-01-25: Maintain Single Source of Truth for Analysis

**Context**: Codebase analysis could become stale or accumulate incorrect assumptions over time.

**Decision**: Regenerate CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md from scratch after each implementation rather than updating it incrementally.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Update analysis incrementally (rejected: drift from reality)
2. Version analyses with dates (rejected: too much overhead)
3. No analysis (rejected: loses valuable insights)

**Rationale**:
- Fresh analysis prevents accumulated errors
- Forces thorough review of changes in context
- Identifies emergent patterns and issues

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Analysis always accurate and comprehensive
- Positive: Catches integration issues early
- Negative: More time spent on analysis
- Negative: Some historical context lost (mitigated by CHANGES.md)

**Related Changes**: See workflow process updates

<!-- Example entries for reference:

## 2025-01-26: Repository Pattern for Data Access

**Context**: API calls scattered throughout components making testing difficult and creating tight coupling.

**Decision**: Implement Repository pattern with interfaces for all data access.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Keep direct API calls in components (rejected: hard to test)
2. Simple service functions (rejected: less flexible)
3. GraphQL (rejected: overkill for current needs)

**Rationale**:
- Enables easy mocking for tests
- Centralizes data access logic
- Allows swapping implementations (mock vs real)
- Better separation of concerns

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Much easier to test components
- Positive: Can swap between mock and real APIs
- Positive: Business logic separated from data access
- Negative: Additional abstraction layer
- Negative: More boilerplate initially

**Related Changes**: See CHANGES.md "Refactor API Layer to Repository Pattern"

## 2025-01-27: React Query for Server State Management

**Context**: Managing loading, error, and cache states manually in components was error-prone and repetitive.

**Decision**: Use React Query (TanStack Query) for all server state management.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Redux + RTK Query (rejected: too heavy for our needs)
2. SWR (rejected: smaller ecosystem)
3. Manual state management (rejected: too much boilerplate)

**Rationale**:
- Built-in caching and synchronization
- Excellent DevTools
- Automatic retries and error handling
- Optimistic updates support
- Strong TypeScript support

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Reduced boilerplate by ~60%
- Positive: Consistent loading/error states
- Positive: Better performance with caching
- Negative: New dependency
- Negative: Learning curve for team

**Related Changes**: See migration to React Query in CHANGES.md
