# SIM Implementation Plan: Frontend Demonstration with Production-Ready Architecture

## Overview
This plan focuses on building a complete frontend demonstration with mock backend integration. The goal is to showcase the full user experience in a browser while maintaining production-ready architecture that can seamlessly connect to a real backend when ready. All API calls follow production patterns but return mock data from our Express server, allowing stakeholders to experience realistic user flows without actual database or third-party service dependencies.

## Core Principles
1. **Frontend-First Development** - Complete UI/UX with mock data before backend integration
2. **Production API Patterns** - All requests use real API endpoints hitting Express mock server
3. **Seamless Backend Integration** - Architecture ready to swap mock server for real backend
4. **Complete User Flows** - Every feature demonstrates full functionality with realistic data
5. **Type Safety Throughout** - TypeScript interfaces match expected backend contracts
6. **Visual Before Testing** - Prioritize browser experience over test coverage initially

## Current Project Status (Last Updated: January 24, 2025)
Based on the comprehensive codebase analysis, the project has achieved:

### ‚úÖ Excellent Foundation
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite with strict mode (95% type coverage)
- Tailwind CSS with complete SynMax design system
- Feature-based architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Zustand for state, React Query for server state
- Express mock API server with RESTful routes
- JWT authentication with protected routes and WebSocket auth
- Comprehensive component library following design patterns
- Single source of truth for data (no duplication)
- **Complete**: Credit deduction system across all services
- **Complete**: Real-time WebSocket infrastructure with live updates

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented Features
- **VTS**: Complete with real-time position updates via WebSocket
