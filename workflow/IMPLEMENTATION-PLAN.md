# SIM Implementation Plan: Test-First Production Frontend with Claude Code

## Overview
This plan establishes test-first development as the foundation for building a world-class production frontend. With the rise of AI-assisted development, comprehensive test coverage is no longer optionalâ€”it's critical for maintaining code quality and enabling confident refactoring. Tests serve as both documentation and validation, ensuring AI-generated code meets specifications. The goal is to achieve 80%+ test coverage before adding new features, using TDD for all future development.

## Core Principles
1. **Tests First, Always** - Write tests before code; 80%+ coverage is mandatory
2. **TDD with AI** - Use Claude Code to generate tests, then implement features
3. **Tests as Documentation** - Tests define behavior and serve as living documentation
4. **Confident Refactoring** - Comprehensive tests enable fearless improvements
5. **Quality Gates** - No code merges without passing tests and coverage thresholds

### Why Test-First Matters Now
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Tests validate AI-generated code meets requirements
- **Rapid Iteration**: Tests enable quick, confident changes without regression
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Tests document expected behavior better than comments
- **Production Readiness**: Can't trust untested code in production environments

## Current Project Status (Updated: January 2025)
Based on comprehensive analysis (357 files, 131 directories):

### âœ… Excellent Foundation
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite (95% type coverage)
- Feature-based architecture with 6 major modules
- Complete SynMax design system implementation
- Production-ready API patterns with mock backend
- WebSocket infrastructure with reconnection logic
- Credit system integrated across all services

### ðŸš§ Quality Gaps to Address
- **Test Coverage**: 0% (test infrastructure exists but unused)
- **Hidden Bugs**: Unknown state integrity with 357 untested files
- **Integration Risks**: No contract validation with future backend
- **Performance**: Unoptimized renders and bundle size
- **Documentation**: Minimal inline docs and no ADRs

## Implementation Roadmap
