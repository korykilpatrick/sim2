# SIM Implementation Plan: Zero Tech Debt Approach

## Overview
This plan prioritizes building a production-ready foundation from day one, allowing us to rapidly prototype while maintaining code quality that scales directly to production without rewrites.

## Core Principles
1. **Production Architecture, MVP Features** - Use production-grade patterns but implement minimal feature sets first
2. **Type Safety Throughout** - TypeScript strict mode from the start prevents technical debt
3. **Test as You Build** - Write tests for critical paths during development, not after
4. **Progressive Enhancement** - Each feature is built to be extended, not replaced
5. **Infrastructure as Code** - All configuration is version controlled and reproducible
6. **Single Source of Truth** - Centralized data definitions to prevent duplication

## Current Project Status (Last Updated: January 2025)
Based on the comprehensive codebase analysis, the project has achieved:

### ‚úÖ Excellent Foundation
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite with strict mode
- Tailwind CSS with complete SynMax design system
- Feature-based architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Zustand for state, React Query for server state
- Express mock API server with RESTful routes
- JWT authentication with protected routes
- Comprehensive component library following design patterns
- Single source of truth for data (no duplication)

### üü° Partially Implemented Features
- **VTS**: Full wizard flow, missing real-time updates
- **AMS**: Area definition complete, missing live alerts
- **FTS**: Basic pages, needs full implementation
- **Reports**: Wizard structure exists, no actual generation
- **Credits**: Pricing display only, no purchase flow
- **Cart/Checkout**: UI exists, missing payment integration

### ‚ùå Missing Critical Features
- **VCR/VChR/MIS**: Products defined but not implemented
- **Credits System**: No purchase or balance tracking
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket server exists but not integrated
- **Alert Delivery**: No notification system
- **Team Management**: Referenced but not implemented
- **Report Generation**: No PDF/export functionality

## Key Architecture Decisions

Based on the codebase analysis, these decisions have proven successful:

### What's Working Well ‚úÖ
1. **Feature-based Architecture** - Clean separation, easy to extend
2. **Single Source of Truth** - Products centralized, no duplication
3. **Wizard Pattern** - Consistent multi-step flows
4. **Type Safety** - Strict TypeScript preventing bugs
5. **API Patterns** - RESTful, consistent responses
6. **Component Library** - Reusable, well-designed components

### Architecture Patterns to Continue
1. **State Management**: Zustand for global, React Query for server state
2. **Styling**: Tailwind with SynMax design tokens
3. **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
4. **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
5. **API**: REST with mock server, ready for production
6. **Real-time**: Socket.io with reconnection logic

## Critical Missing Features Summary

From the codebase analysis, these are the most important gaps:

1. **Business Critical** üî¥
   - No way to purchase credits (payment flow missing)
   - VCR/VChR products not implemented (defined but no UI)
   - No report generation or PDF export
   - No real-time vessel updates

2. **User Experience** üü†
   - No alert/notification system
   - Missing user profile management
   - No credit balance tracking
   - Cart/checkout incomplete

3. **Technical Debt** üü°
   - WebSocket not integrated
   - No error monitoring (Sentry)
   - Limited test coverage
   - No CI/CD pipeline

## Success Metrics for Completion

### MVP Ready (2 weeks)
- [ ] All 6 products functional
- [ ] Credit purchase working
- [ ] Basic alerts implemented
- [ ] Core tests written

### Production Ready (4 weeks)
- [ ] Real-time updates working

- [ ] Documentation complete

## Development Workflow

### For Each Feature
1. **Check Documentation First**
   - Review CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md for gaps
   - Check PRD for requirements
   - Look at existing patterns

2. **Implement with Quality**
   - Write TypeScript interfaces first
   - Follow existing patterns
   - Add loading and error states
   - Ensure mobile responsive

3. **Test As You Build**
   - Unit test business logic
   - Integration test flows
   - Manual test edge cases

### Before Committing
- [ ] Run `npm run lint`

- [ ] Run `npm run format`
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Check error handling

## Implementation Guidelines

### Priority Order
1. **Revenue-generating features first** (credits, products)
2. **Core functionality second** (tracking, monitoring)
3. **Enhanced UX third** (real-time, notifications)
4. **Polish last** (animations, optimizations)

### Quality Standards
- **TypeScript**: No `any` types, strict mode
- **Components**: Props interface, error boundaries
- **API Calls**: Loading states, error handling
- **Forms**: Validation, user feedback
- **Mobile**: Touch targets ‚â•44px, responsive

### Communication Patterns
- **API**: Use centralized client (`/src/api`)
- **State**: Feature stores in Zustand
- **Errors**: User-friendly messages
- **Loading**: Skeleton screens
- **Success**: Toast notifications
