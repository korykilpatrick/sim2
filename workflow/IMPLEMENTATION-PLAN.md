# SIM Implementation Plan - TDD Frontend Completion

_Last Updated: May 28, 2025_

## Overview

This plan outlines the path to complete a fully implemented frontend for the SIM PRD using Test-Driven Development (TDD). The goal is to build a tech-debt-free implementation that can later be enhanced with performance features and connected to a real backend.

## Guiding Principles

1. **TDD First**: Write failing tests before implementing any feature
2. **Zero Tech Debt**: Fix issues immediately, never compromise quality
3. **PRD Alignment**: Every feature must match PRD specifications exactly
4. **No Backwards Compatibility**: We have zero users - always choose the ideal solution
5. **Mock Everything**: Build against comprehensive mock data until real backend available
