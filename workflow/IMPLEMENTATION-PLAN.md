# SIM Implementation Plan: Zero Tech Debt Approach

## Overview
This plan prioritizes building a production-ready foundation from day one, allowing us to rapidly prototype while maintaining code quality that scales directly to production without rewrites.

## Core Principles
1. **Production Architecture, MVP Features** - Use production-grade patterns but implement minimal feature sets first
2. **Type Safety Throughout** - TypeScript strict mode from the start prevents technical debt
3. **Test as You Build** - Write tests for critical paths during development, not after
4. **Progressive Enhancement** - Each feature is built to be extended, not replaced
5. **Infrastructure as Code** - All configuration is version controlled and reproducible
6. **Single Source of Truth** - Centralized data definitions to prevent duplication

## Current Project Status (Last Updated: January 2025)
Based on the comprehensive codebase analysis, the project has achieved:

### ‚úÖ Excellent Foundation
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite with strict mode
- Tailwind CSS with complete SynMax design system
- Feature-based architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Zustand for state, React Query for server state
- Express mock API server with RESTful routes
- JWT authentication with protected routes
- Comprehensive component library following design patterns
- Single source of truth for data (no duplication)

### üü° Partially Implemented Features
- **VTS**: Full wizard flow, missing real-time updates
- **AMS**: Area definition complete, missing live alerts

## Development Workflow

### For Each Feature
1. **Check Documentation First**
   - Review CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md for gaps
   - Check PRD for requirements
   - Look at existing patterns

2. **Implement with Quality**
   - Write TypeScript interfaces first
   - Follow existing patterns
   - Add loading and error states
   - Ensure mobile responsive

3. **Test As You Build**
   - Unit test business logic
   - Integration test flows
   - Manual test edge cases

### Before Committing
- [ ] Run `npm run lint`
- [ ] Run `npm run typecheck`
- [ ] Run `npm run format`
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Check error handling

## Implementation Guidelines

### Priority Order
1. **Revenue-generating features first** (credits, products)
2. **Core functionality second** (tracking, monitoring)
3. **Enhanced UX third** (real-time, notifications)
4. **Polish last** (animations, optimizations)

### Quality Standards
- **TypeScript**: No `any` types, strict mode
- **Components**: Props interface, error boundaries
- **API Calls**: Loading states, error handling
- **Forms**: Validation, user feedback
- **Mobile**: Touch targets ‚â•44px, responsive

### Communication Patterns
- **API**: Use centralized client (`/src/api`)
- **State**: Feature stores in Zustand
- **Errors**: User-friendly messages
- **Loading**: Skeleton screens
- **Success**: Toast notifications
