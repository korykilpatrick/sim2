# SIM Implementation Plan: Test-First Production Frontend with Claude Code

## Overview
This plan establishes test-first development as the foundation for building a world-class production frontend. With the rise of AI-assisted development, comprehensive test coverage is no longer optional‚Äîit's critical for maintaining code quality and enabling confident refactoring. Tests serve as both documentation and validation, ensuring AI-generated code meets specifications. The goal is to achieve 80%+ test coverage before adding new features, using TDD for all future development.

## Core Principles
1. **Tests First, Always** - Write tests before code; 80%+ coverage is mandatory
2. **TDD with AI** - Use Claude Code to generate tests, then implement features
3. **Tests as Documentation** - Tests define behavior and serve as living documentation
4. **Confident Refactoring** - Comprehensive tests enable fearless improvements
5. **Quality Gates** - No code merges without passing tests and coverage thresholds

### Why Test-First Matters Now
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Tests validate AI-generated code meets requirements
- **Rapid Iteration**: Tests enable quick, confident changes without regression
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Tests document expected behavior better than comments
- **Production Readiness**: Can't trust untested code in production environments

## Current Project Status (Updated: January 25, 2025 - End of Day)
Based on comprehensive analysis (357 files, 131 directories) and today's progress:

### ‚úÖ Excellent Foundation
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite (95% type coverage)
- Feature-based architecture with 6 major modules
- Complete SynMax design system implementation
- Production-ready API patterns with mock backend
- WebSocket infrastructure with reconnection logic
- Credit system integrated across all services

### üöß Quality Gaps to Address
- **Test Coverage**: ~25% (147/250 tests passing) - Up from 5%
  - ‚úÖ Auth: 100% coverage (59 tests added today)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è WebSocket: ~80% coverage (51/64 passing)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Credits: ~25% coverage (5/5 unit tests passing, 70 integration tests failing)
- **Hidden Bugs**: Unknown state integrity with 300+ untested files
- **Integration Risks**: No contract validation with future backend
- **Performance**: Unoptimized renders and bundle size
- **Documentation**: Minimal inline docs and no ADRs
- **WebSocket Issues**: Room rejoin race condition, memory leak risks

## Implementation Roadmap

### üî¥ Phase 1: Test Foundation - TOP PRIORITY (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Achieve 80%+ test coverage as the foundation for all future work

**Why This Comes First**:
- Current 0% coverage means we're flying blind
- 357 untested files could hide critical bugs
- AI-assisted development requires test validation
- Can't refactor confidently without test safety net

**Current Status & Priorities**:
1. **Credit System (CRITICAL)**: 103 failing tests indicate broken core functionality. Credits are essential for all paid features - fixing this unblocks everything else.
2. **Core Hooks**: Basic utilities like toast, debounce, and localStorage are used throughout. Testing these provides foundation for component tests.
3. **API Contracts**: With 95% TypeScript coverage, we need runtime validation to catch API mismatches early.
