# Phase 3: Testing Excellence - Progress Report

## âœ… Completed (Fixed High-Priority Tests)

### 1. API Validation Tests (11 tests fixed)

- Updated schemas to match current implementation
- Fixed auth response schema (tokens now in httpOnly cookies)
- Added support for 'superadmin' role and 'zone' area type
- Updated credit balance schema for backwards compatibility
- Fixed validation test expectations

### 2. WebSocketProvider Tests (11 tests fixed)

- Updated to match new auth flow (cookies instead of token passing)
- Fixed console.log/error assertions to handle timestamps
- Fixed config mocking for feature flags
- Updated disconnect logic for auth state changes

### 3. Authentication Hook Tests (13 tests fixed)

- Mocked CSRF token utilities
- Fixed loading state tests with proper promise handling
- Updated auth service expectations
- All auth flow tests now passing

### 4. WebSocket Service Tests (28 tests fixed)

- Updated all connect() calls to not require token
- Fixed reconnection test to properly simulate events
- Updated authentication flow expectations
- All websocket service tests now passing

### 5. Test Infrastructure Fixes (Day 1 - New)

- Fixed import issues in credit integration tests (setupAuthenticatedUser, clearAuth, userEvent)
- Fixed WebSocketProvider Router context errors
- Fixed auth store integration tests (removed non-existent token references)
- Added missing data-testids to components

### 6. Credit Integration Tests (Day 2 - Completed)

- Fixed credit package display format ($10.00 vs $10)
- Added test-specific credit packages for consistent testing
- Fixed credit balance WebSocket event handling
- Fixed import paths for VesselTrackingPage and AreaMonitoringPage
- Fixed credit reservation logic to use actual amounts
- Updated error handling expectations in tests
- Added "Best Value" badge for 1000 credit package
- Removed 'any' type from mock handler (~17 tests fixed)

### 7. WebSocket Tests (Day 2 - In Progress)

- Fixed useWebSocket hook tests (auth via cookies)
- Fixed WebSocket race condition tests (7 tests)
- Added room_joined/room_left event support
- Fixed WebSocket integration test setup
- Updated test component to track room state properly

## ðŸ“Š Test Coverage Progress

- **Before Phase 3**: 97 failing tests
- **After initial fixes**: 85 failing tests
- **After Day 1**: 77 failing tests
- **After credit fixes**: ~60 failing tests
- **Current status**: ~16 failing tests (major improvement!)
- **Total tests fixed**: ~81 tests (83% reduction)
- **Current coverage**: 79.14% â†’ targeting 85%+

## ðŸ”„ Remaining Work (~16 failing tests)

### By Category:

1. **WebSocket Integration Tests** (~12 failures)

   - Full connection flow (disconnect on logout)
   - Real-time event handling (vessel updates, area alerts, credit balance)
   - Room management (join/leave/rejoin)
   - Error handling (connection errors, unauthorized, reconnection)
   - Multiple component state sharing

2. **WebSocketProvider Tests** (~4 failures)

   - Disconnect on logout
   - Debug mode listener registration
   - Edge cases (WebSocket disabled, rapid auth changes)

3. **Other Tests** (Unknown count)
   - Component tests (if any remaining)
   - Other integration tests

### Low Priority (Phase 3 Week 2)

1. **E2E Test Setup**

   - Install and configure Playwright
   - Create basic test scenarios
   - Setup CI integration

2. **Visual Regression Testing**

   - Setup visual testing framework
   - Create baseline screenshots
   - Integrate with CI

3. **Performance Benchmarks**

   - Setup performance testing
   - Create baseline metrics
   - Monitor bundle size

4. **Accessibility Tests**
   - Setup axe-core integration
   - Create a11y test suite
   - Fix any violations

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. Continue fixing remaining integration tests
2. Address component test failures
3. Setup E2E testing framework
4. Aim for 85%+ coverage by end of Phase 3

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings

1. **Authentication Flow Changes**: The move to httpOnly cookies required updates across many tests
2. **WebSocket Architecture**: The enhanced websocket service with state machine required careful test updates
3. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript helped catch many issues during test fixes
4. **Test Organization**: Clear separation of unit/integration/e2e tests helps prioritize fixes

## ðŸš€ Impact

- Improved confidence in codebase quality
- Better documentation through tests
- Foundation for continuous integration
- Reduced risk of regressions
