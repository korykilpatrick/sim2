# Multi-Agent Development System v2.0

This directory contains an autonomous 6-agent development system capable of building a world-class codebase without human intervention.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# First time setup
./agent-coordination/initialize-system.sh

# Start all agents
./start-agents.sh

# Monitor in another terminal
./monitor-agents.sh

# Stop all agents
./stop-agents.sh
```

### 6. Visual QA Agent

- **Role**: Automated UI testing
- **Features**:
  - Puppeteer integration
  - Visual regression detection
  - Accessibility testing
  - Performance monitoring

## 🧠 Autonomous Intelligence

### Task Decomposition

Large tasks are automatically broken down:

```
"Build tracking wizard" →
  - Create wizard container (2h)
  - Build vessel search (1h)
  - Implement criteria selection (2h)
  - Add pricing calculator (1h)
  - Create review step (2h)
  - Write integration tests (2h)
```

### Knowledge Base

System learns and improves:

- **Pattern Library**: Reusable code patterns
- **Decision Log**: Architecture choices with rationale
- **Error Patterns**: Common mistakes and solutions

### Priority Intelligence

Dynamic task prioritization:

- Test failures: Priority 100
- Security issues: Priority 95
- Coverage drops: Priority 90
- Feature implementation: Priority 50-80
- Enhancements: Priority 30-50

## 🔄 Autonomous Workflow

1. **Initialization**

   - System checks prerequisites
   - Loads knowledge base
   - Verifies code state

2. **Task Assignment**

   - Orchestrator reads ATOMIC-TASKS.json
   - Calculates priorities dynamically
   - Assigns to available agents
   - Monitors progress

3. **Implementation Cycle**

   - Agent receives atomic task
   - Writes comprehensive tests
   - Implements minimal code
   - Ensures quality gates pass
   - Commits to feature branch

4. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Patterns extracted and shared
   - Decisions documented
   - Errors cataloged with solutions
   - Metrics tracked for optimization

## 📊 Monitoring Dashboard

The monitor shows:

- Agent health status (✅/⚠️/❌)
- Atomic task progress
- Test coverage trends
- Knowledge base growth
- System performance metrics
- Recent activity feed

## 🛡️ Quality Enforcement

### Absolute Rules

- **No coverage drops** - Ever
- **Tests first** - No exceptions
- **No direct commits** - Only through PR
- **Pattern compliance** - Follow established patterns
- **Documentation required** - Code without docs rejected

### Quality Gates

Every task must pass:

- All tests passing
- Coverage maintained/increased
- Linting clean
- Type checking passes
- Documentation updated
- No critical audit findings

## 🚨 Emergency Protocols

### Automatic Interventions

- Test failures: All feature work blocked
- Coverage drop: Immediate task generation
- Agent failure: Automatic restart and reassignment
- Merge conflicts: Intelligent resolution

### Human Intervention Required

Only needed if:

- Coverage < 75% (critical)
- > 3 agents offline
- System deadlock (no progress 1hr)
- Security vulnerability detected

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Development Velocity

- Tasks/day: 50+ (target)
- Avg completion: <2.5 hours
- First-pass rate: >85%
- Rework rate: <10%

### Code Quality

- Coverage trend: +0.5%/day
- Type violations: 0
- Pattern compliance: >90%
- Documentation coverage: 100%

### System Health

- Agent uptime: >95%
- Assignment efficiency: <30s
- Knowledge growth: 5+ patterns/week

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Working

1. Check heartbeat: `ls -la agent-coordination/heartbeats/`
2. View agent logs in iTerm tab
3. Check inbox for tasks
4. Verify no file locks

### Tasks Not Progressing

1. Check orchestrator tab
2. View task assignments
3. Look for blocked dependencies
4. Check system health

### Coverage Dropping

1. Test Sentinel will block immediately
2. Check recent commits
3. View generated test tasks
4. Monitor test execution

## 🚀 Advanced Features

## 🎯 Goal

Build a world-class codebase that:

- Implements the PRD completely
- Maintains 85%+ test coverage
- Has zero technical debt
- Follows consistent patterns
- Is fully documented
- Performs optimally

All without human intervention.
