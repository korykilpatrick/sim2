## Critical Missing Pieces for True Autonomy

### 1. **Ambiguity Resolution**

Currently missing automated way to:

- Detect ambiguous requirements
- Generate clarifying questions
- Make reasonable assumptions
- Document decisions made

### 2. **Integration Testing**

Need automated:

- Cross-feature integration tests
- End-to-end user flow validation
- API contract testing
- WebSocket event verification

### 3. **Performance Management**

Requires:

- Automated performance profiling
- Bundle size monitoring
- Runtime performance checks
- Optimization task generation

### 4. **Long-Term Memory**

System needs:

- Persistent knowledge across restarts
- Historical decision tracking
- Pattern evolution tracking
- Team learning consolidation

### 5. **Architectural Evolution**

Missing capability to:

- Refactor when patterns emerge
- Consolidate duplicate code
- Optimize module boundaries
- Evolve system architecture

## Metrics for Autonomous Success

Track these KPIs to measure autonomous operation:

### Development Velocity

- Tasks completed per day: Target 50+
- Average task completion time: <2.5 hours
- First-pass success rate: >85%
- Rework rate: <10%

### Code Quality

- Test coverage trend: +0.5% daily
- Type safety violations: 0
- Linting errors: 0
- Pattern compliance: >90%

### System Health

- Agent availability: >95%
- Task assignment efficiency: <30 seconds
- Merge success rate: >90%
- Rollback frequency: <5%

### Knowledge Growth

- New patterns per week: 5+
- Decision documentation: 100%
- Error pattern reuse: >60%
- Cross-agent learning: Active

## Emergency Protocols

### When to Intervene

Human intervention needed only if:

1. Test coverage drops below 75%
2. More than 3 agents offline
3. Merge conflicts can't be resolved
4. Security vulnerability detected
5. System deadlock (no progress 1hr+)

### Recovery Procedures

1. Check system logs first
2. Verify all agents healthy
3. Review recent decisions
4. Check for blocking tasks
5. Restart affected agents only

## Launch Readiness Score

Current readiness: **85%**

Ready to launch when:

- [ ] All critical missing pieces addressed
- [ ] Knowledge base has 20+ patterns
- [ ] 24-hour test run successful
- [ ] All emergency protocols tested
- [ ] Metrics tracking automated
